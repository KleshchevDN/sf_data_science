Prodject description
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.

What case are we solving?
You need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

Conditions of the problem:

The computer guesses a number from 1 to 100, and we need to write a program that will guess the number in the minimum number of attempts.
The algorithm must take into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts per thousand repetitions.
What are we practicing? Learn to write good code in Python.
